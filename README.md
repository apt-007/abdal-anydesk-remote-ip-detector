## üíé Introduction
The Abdal AnyDesk Remote IP Detector is a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) tool that exploits a vulnerability in AnyDesk‚Äôs "Allow Direct Connections" feature. When this option is enabled and the connection port is set to 7070 on the attacker's system only, it allows a user with only the AnyDesk ID of the target to retrieve their public IP address without requiring any settings to be changed on the target system. Additionally, if both systems are connected to the same network, it is also possible to obtain the private IP address of the target.


## üíÄ Vulnerability Overview
This vulnerability leverages the "Allow Direct Connections" feature in AnyDesk, potentially exposing sensitive IP information of a target. Attackers can use this flaw to acquire the public IP and, under certain conditions, the private IP address of the target machine. The vulnerability highlights privacy risks associated with remote access tools when security settings are not appropriately configured.

## ‚ú® Features
* Retrieves public IP address of a remote system when AnyDesk ID is known.
* Private IP detection within local network connections.
* Quick setup and straightforward PoC execution.
* No complex dependencies;
 

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment Setup
- **.NET 6**
- **Visual Studio 2022**
 

## üî• Requirements
There are no specific prerequisites needed to run this PoC.

## üì• Download
To download the executable versions of this PoC, please visit the official Releases page on GitHub. This will allow you to obtain the compiled version ready for use:

## üì¶ Setup and Usage
1. Enable Direct Connections in AnyDesk: Open AnyDesk on your system, go to Settings > Connection, then enable the option Allow direct connections. Set the connection port to 7070.
2. Launch the PoC Tool: Run the Abdal AnyDesk Remote IP Detector tool.
3. Enter Target AnyDesk ID: In the AnyDesk application on your system, input the AnyDesk ID of the target system.
4. IP Retrieval via Network Traffic Monitoring: After entering the target's AnyDesk ID in your AnyDesk, the PoC tool automatically listens to the network traffic on your system to detect and display the public IP address of the target. If both systems are within the same local network, the tool will also display the target's private IP address.


## üòé Expected Output
The tool will output:

* The public IP address of the remote system.
* The private IP address if the two systems are within the same local network.



## ‚úÖ Mitigation
Unfortunately, there is currently no user-side fix for this vulnerability. To fully address this issue, an update or patch from AnyDesk‚Äôs development team is required.
